The [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) blog system that optimized for [**Microsoft Azure**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). Designed for developers, enabling most common blogging features including posts, comments, categories, archive, tags and pages.

**IMPORTANT: Moonglade will move to .NET 8 LTS in November 2023 with v14.x release**

## 📦 Deployment

- HTTPS is required, and it is recommended to enable HTTP/2 support on your web server.

### ☁ Full Deploy on Azure

This is the way https://edi.wang is deployed, by taking advantage of as many Azure services as possible, the blog can run very fast and secure.

### 💾 Setup Database

Moonglade supports three types of database. You can choose from SQL Server, PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Update your database connection string in `appsettings.*.json`

  "MoongladeDatabase": "Server=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Database=Moonglade;Trusted_Connection=True;",
  "DatabaseType": "SqlServer"
}
```
#### MySQL

  "DatabaseType": "MySql"
}
```

#### PostgreSql

```json
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "MoongladeDatabase": "User ID=****;Password=****;Host=localhost;Port=5432;Database=****;Pooling=true;",
  "DatabaseType": "PostgreSql"
}
```

### 🔨 Build Source

Build and run `./src/Moonglade.sln`
- Admin: `https://localhost:1055/admin`
- Default username: `admin`
- Default password: `admin123`

## ⚙ Configuration

> This section discuss environment settings in **appsettings.[env].json**. For blog settings, please use "/admin/settings" UI.

### 🛡 Authentication

> You can choose one authentication provider from below.

#### [Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/)

See [Wiki document](https://github.com/EdiWang/Moonglade/wiki/Use-Microsoft-Entra-ID-Authentication)

#### Local Account

Set `Authentication:Provider` to `"Local"`. You can manage accounts in `/admin/settings/account`

### 🖼 Image Storage
`ImageStorage` controls how blog post images are stored.

#### [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) (Preferred)

You need to create an [**Azure Blob Storage**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) with **container level permission**. 

```json
{
  "Provider": "azurestorage"
  "AzureStorageSettings": {
    "ConnectionString": "YOUR CONNECTION STRING",
    "ContainerName": "YOUR CONTAINER NAME"
  }
}
```

When configured the image storage to use Azure Blob, you can take advantage of CDN for your image resources. Just enable CDN in admin settings, the blog will get images from CDN.

#### [Minio Blob Storage](https://min.io/)

You need to hava an [**Minio Server**](https://docs.min.io/). 

```json
"Provider": "miniostorage"
"MinioStorageSettings": {
  "EndPoint": "Minio Server Endpoint(eg:localhost:9600)",
  "AccessKey": "Your Access Key",
  "SecretKey": "Your Secret Key",
  "BucketName": "Your BucketName",
  "WithSSL": false
}
```

#### File System (Not Recommended)
