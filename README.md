# Moonglade Blog

Moonglade is a personal blogging platform optimized for deployment on [**Microsoft Azure**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). It is designed with developers in mind, offering essential blogging features such as posts, comments, categories, archives, tags, and pages.

## 📦 Deployment Notice

- **Stable Code:** Always use the stable code from the [Release](https://github.com/EdiWang/Moonglade/releases) branch instead of the master branch.

- **Security:** Enable HTTPS and HTTP/2 on your web server for enhanced security and performance.

- **Deployment Options:** While Azure is recommended, Moonglade Blog can also be deployed on other cloud providers or on-premises environments.

- **Regulation:** Due to regulation concerns in China, Moonglade will run in read-only mode when deployed in China. If you are in China, please consider another blogging platform.

### Full Deploy on Azure

This is the way https://edi.wang is deployed, by taking advantage of as many Azure services as possible, the blog can run very fast and secure. There is no automated script to deploy it, you need to manually create all the resources.

## ⚙ Configuration

> This section is for **appsettings.json**. For other blog settings, please use "/admin/settings" UI.

### Authentication

You can also use  [Microsoft Entra ID](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/active-directory/) to login. See [Wiki document](https://github.com/EdiWang/Moonglade/wiki/Use-Microsoft-Entra-ID-Authentication) for setup Microsoft Entra ID.

### Image Storage
`ImageStorage` controls how blog post images are stored.

#### [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) (Preferred)

You need to create an [**Azure Blob Storage**](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/) with **container level permission**. 

```json
{
  "Provider": "azurestorage"
  "AzureStorageSettings": {
    "ConnectionString": "YOUR CONNECTION STRING",
    "ContainerName": "YOUR CONTAINER NAME"
  }
}
```

When configured the image storage to use Azure Blob, you can take advantage of CDN for your image resources. Just enable CDN in admin settings, the blog will get images from CDN.

#### [Minio Blob Storage](https://min.io/)

You need to hava an [**Minio Server**](https://docs.min.io/). 

```json
"Provider": "miniostorage"
"MinioStorageSettings": {
  "EndPoint": "Minio Server Endpoint(eg:localhost:9600)",
  "AccessKey": "Your Access Key",
  "SecretKey": "Your Secret Key",
  "BucketName": "Your BucketName",
  "WithSSL": false
}
```

#### File System (Not Recommended)

You can also choose File System for image storage if you don't have a cloud option.

Windows Deployment Example:

```json
{
  "Provider": "filesystem",
  "FileSystemPath": "C:\\UploadedImages"
}
```
